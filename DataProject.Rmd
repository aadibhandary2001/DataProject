## Introduction

Athletes from around the world compete at the highest levels at the Olympic Games. This analysis uses a comprehensive dataset spanning 120 years of Olympic history to explore a fundamental question: What factors contribute to an athlete winning a medal?

Our Athlete Events dataset, provides a repository of information about Olympic participants, including their physical characteristics, age, and sport. By focusing on male athletes in Summer Olympic Games from 2004 onwards, we aim to develop a predictive model that can help understand the key determinants of Olympic success.

The primary goal of this research is to construct a robust statistical model that can predict whether an athlete is likely to win a medal based on attributes such as height, weight, and age. This model could provide valuable insights for athletes and coaches in understanding the physiological factors that might influence Olympic performance.

## Methods

### Data Preparation

We began by preprocessing the Olympic Athletes Events dataset with several key steps:

1. **Data Filtering**:
   - Selected only Summer Olympic Games
   - Focused exclusively on male athletes
   - Restricted data to games from 2004 onwards

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed entries with missing height, weight, or age data
   - Created a binary "Podium" variable (1 for medal winners, 0 for non-medalists)

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Utilized an 80-20 train-test split for model development and validation

### Modeling Approach

In order to accurately test the three hypotheses we developed, we must first establish a standard that the three models can be compared to. The first is accuracy and the second is RMSE.

Below is the formula for Accuracy:
$Accuracy = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{1000}Correct}{\sum_{i = 1}^{1000}Test Length}$

Below is the formula for RMSE (where i is one of 1000 iterations:
$RMSE_i = \sqrt{\sum_{j = 1}^{Test Length}\frac{(\hat{y}-y)^2}{Test Length}}$

This dataset required additional preprocessing as we wish for more “modern” data to be included, as the demographics and physical form of athletes may change drastically across a century. 

Furthermore the results section will include a ROC curve to account for the true positive rate as well as the false positive rate. This is because the number of medalists is a substantially small fraction of the number of participants within a sport. 


1. **Basic Model**: 
   - Predictors: Height, Weight, Age
   - Simple linear relationship with medal probability

3. **Basic Logistic Model**: 
   - Predictors: Height * Weight + Age
   - Explored potential interactive effects between physical attributes

3. **Interaction Model**: 
   - Predictors: Height * Weight + Age
   - Explored potential interactive effects between physical attributes

4. **Stepwise AIC Model**: 
   - Used automated model selection with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
   - Considered additional predictors like Sport and interaction terms
   - Employed bidirectional selection to identify the most parsimonious model

### Model Evaluation

We assessed model performance using multiple metrics:

- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Accuracy
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
- Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

## Results

### Model Performance Comparison

```{r}
#Basic Model
basic_model = glm(Podium ~ Height + Weight + Age, data = train_data, family = "binomial")

#Linear model
linear_model = lm(Podium ~ Age + Height + Weight, data = train_data)

#Interaction Model
interaction_model = glm(Podium ~ Height * Weight + Age, data = train_data, family = "binomial")

#Stepwise AIC
step_model = step(glm(Podium ~ 1,  #initial search starts from intercept
                      data = train_data, family = "binomial"), 
                      scope = ~ Height + Weight + Age + factor(Year) + factor(Sport) + Weight:Age + Height:Age, 
                      direction = "both", trace=FALSE)
```

Our analysis revealed differences among the three models:

(Include table for RMSE and accuracy for each of the 3 models)
(Include ROC curve)

The ROC curve visualizes the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different classification thresholds. From our plot, we can observe:

- The Stepwise AIC model (green) appears to demonstrate the most favorable performance
- Interaction model (red) shows moderate predictive capability
- Basic model (blue) exhibits the most limited discriminative power

### Selected Model

The Stepwise AIC model emerged as our preferred approach, incorporating:
- Height
- Weight
- Age
- Sport (as a factor)
- Interaction terms between Weight:Age and Height:Age

## Discussion

Our analysis suggests that predicting Olympic medal achievement is a task influenced by multiple interrelated factors. Physical attributes like height and weight play a role, and contextual variables like the sport help provide a slightly better understanding.

Key insights:
- Physical attributes (height, weight, age) alone are sufficient to predict medal success
- Context of sport and interaction effects between age and physical characteristics help improve accuracy
